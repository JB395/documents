https://rpmrepo.qtum.info

### Archlinux

[Get it from the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/qtum-core/) 

More distributions will be added in the future, this document will be updated to reflect those changes.

### Tutorial focus

This tutorial assumes you have a basic knowledge of Linux and terminal usage, the entire process uses the Linux terminal.

## Installing on Ubuntu

### Obtaining signing key

First, we need to obtain the Qtum signing key from the ubuntu keyserver, here's how:

`sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys  BF5B197D`

This will download and add the Qtum signing key to your linux install.

### Adding repository to your APT sources.

`sudo su` - Sudo to root first

` echo "deb https://repo.qtum.info/apt/ubuntu/ bionic main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/qtum.list`

This will add the repository to your APT sources file. **NOTE:** Please remember to change "xenial" for your Ubuntu version codename *(for instance, Ubuntu 19.10 codename is eoan, in this case you need to replace bionic for eoan)*

### Refreshing APT sources and installing Qtum

`sudo apt update && sudo apt install qtum`

By doing this, we'll update our sources and install Qtum on our ubuntu Box

## Installing on Debian

First, we need to make sure **sudo** is installed: 

Type `sudo su` and press enter, if you get a password prompt, then you can move on to obtaining the public key

### Installing sudo

Obtain admin privileges (su to root) and then type your admin user (root) password

Once you're logged in as "root" please type the following: `apt-get install sudo`

When sudo finishes installing, add your user to the sudo group: `gpasswd -a youruser sudo`
Logout and then log in again.

### Installing dirmngr and apt-transport-https

These two packages are needed to enable the Qtum repository on Debian, let's install them:

`apt install -y apt-transport-https dirmngr`

### Obtaining Public key

`sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys  BF5B197D`

This downloads and installs the Qtum public key

### Adding repository to your APT sources.

`sudo su` - Sudo to root first

` echo "deb https://repo.qtum.info/apt/debian/ buster main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/qtum.list`

This will add the repository to your APT sources file. **NOTE:** Please remember to change "stretch" for your Debian version codename <!--(for instance, Debian 8.x codename is jessie, in this case you need to replace stretch for jessie)-->

### Refreshing APT sources and installing Qtum

`sudo apt update && sudo apt install qtum`

By doing this, we'll update our sources and install Qtum on our debian Box

## Install on Centos/Redhat/Fedora

These are the steps you need to take to install Qtum in a RPM-based distribution

1. Install the public key for the RPM repository:
   
   `sudo rpm --import https://rpmrepo.qtum.info/key.asc  `

2. Add the Qtum repository:
   
   `sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://rpmrepo.qtum.info/`

3. `sudo yum update`

4. `sudo yum install qtum`

You can also use dnf to install Qtum on Fedora and distributions that support it.

## Install on Archlinux

To install on arch, the easiest way is to use "yay" https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yay

`yay qtum-core`

Compiling Qtum should take a few mins, if you're familiar with yay, it's an AUR helper which really simplifies the process of installing packages from the Archlinux AUR. 

## Launching Qtum

Launching is simple, we just go to our applications menu and scrolldown/search for qtum

This works, we can launch our Qtum wallet and start syncing!
